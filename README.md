```

## Architecture

The JOKENPO app was developed using the MVVC architecture, which stands for Model, View, View Model, Controller. The Model represents the data and business logic of the app, the View is responsible for the app's user interface, and the View Model acts as a middleman between the Model and the View. The Controller, in this case, is represented by the BLoC (Business Logic Component) library.

## Libraries

The JOKENPO app uses the following libraries:

-   Provider: A library that provides a simple way to manage state in a Flutter app.
-   BLoC: A library that separates business logic from presentation in Flutter apps.
