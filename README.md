**JokenPo** is a casual game inspired by the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors," but with a unique twist. The game features additional elements, animations, and modern functionalities. It was developed as a personal project to practice and improve Flutter development skills, focusing on architecture, state management, and animations.

## 📖 About the Game

-   🔥 **Fire**
-   ⚡ **Lightning**
